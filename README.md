# RaspberrySharp

RaspberrySharp is a high performance .NET library for Raspberry Pi boards. Based on former Raspberry-Sharp (R.I.P.), it has been completely refactored. 
It provides all IO bus availables on Pis, included Compute Model 3 and GPIO over 31. 
The implementation is based on the work by Eric Bezine <http://www.raspberry-sharp.org/author/eric-bezine/>.

## Features
* GPIO from 1 to 45 (CM3 has 45 GPIOs)
* GPIO removed confusion between Connector Pin and GPIO Pin numbers, only GPIO numbers
* I2C bus			      (included repeated start as protocol request)
* I2C Detect			  (beta)
* SPI				      (beta)
* OneWire          
* No dependencies, just one library
* Many samples to show the functionality 

## Supported frameworks

* .NET Standard 2.0+
* .NET Framework 4.6.2+ (x86, x64, AnyCPU)
* Mono 5.2+

## Supported Raspberry Pi versions

* Raspberry Pi 1 model A
* Raspberry Pi 1 model B  
* Raspberry Pi 2 model B (+)
* Raspberry Pi 3 model B (+)
* Raspberry Pi Zero
* Raspberry Pi Zero W
* Raspberry Pi CM1
* Raspberry Pi CM3
